# Multi Bracket Validation

**Author** : Jay Adams, Tyler Fishbone, Jeremy Crawford, Ramon Mendoza
**Version**: 0.1.1

## Overview
Our group has chosen to pursue a project wherein we will utilize a raspberry pi with a connected camera to conduct facial recognition on people who interact with it. Our plan is to utilize the ‘Rekognition’ web service offered by amazon to do this:

Our application will enable ‘approved’ users to register with the app so that when they interact with it, positive feedback is given in the form of a green or red light and further down the line maybe an unlocked door on an event fridge...

## Goal
Our aim with this project is to develop skills using industry standard tools (Rekognition and Raspberry Pi) that we can then bring to employers after code fellows ends, as well as have a project that is easily extendable as we look to grow our portfolio of ‘passion projects’.

## Getting Started
Set up instructions will be added once our project is a bit more firmed up.

## Assets
